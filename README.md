## üîπ 1. What is a _Tree Data Structure_?

### Answer

A **tree data structure** is a hierarchical collection of nodes, typically visualized with a root at the top. Trees are typically used for representing relationships, hierarchies, and facilitating efficient data operations.

### Core Definitions

- **Node**: The basic unit of a tree that contains data and may link to child nodes.
- **Root**: The tree's topmost node; no nodes point to the root.
- **Parent / Child**: Nodes with a direct connection; a parent points to its children.
- **Leaf**: A node that has no children.
- **Edge**: A link or reference from one node to another.
- **Depth**: The level of a node, or its distance from the root.
- **Height**: Maximum depth of any node in the tree.

### Key Characteristics

- **Hierarchical**: Organized in parent-child relationships.
- **Non-Sequential**: Non-linear data storage ensures flexible and efficient access patterns.
- **Directed**: Nodes are connected unidirectionally.
- **Acyclic**: Trees do not have loops or cycles.
- **Diverse Node Roles**: Such as root and leaf.

### Common Tree Variants

- **Binary Tree**: Each node has a maximum of two children.
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A binary tree where each node's left subtree has values less than the node and the right subtree has values greater.
- **AVL Tree**: A BST that self-balances to optimize searches.
- **B-Tree**: Commonly used in databases to enable efficient access.
- **Red-Black Tree**: A BST that maintains balance using node coloring.
- **Trie**: Specifically designed for efficient string operations.

### Practical Applications

- **File Systems**: Model directories and files.
- **AI and Decision Making**: Decision trees help in evaluating possible actions.
- **Database Systems**: Many databases use trees to index data efficiently.

### Tree Traversals

#### Depth-First Search

- **Preorder**: Root, Left, Right.
- **Inorder**: Left, Root, Right (specific to binary trees).
- **Postorder**: Left, Right, Root.

#### Breadth-First Search

- **Level Order**: Traverse nodes by depth, moving from left to right.

### Code Example: Binary Tree

Here is the Python code:

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
        self.data = data

# Create a tree structure
root = Node(1)
root.left, root.right = Node(2), Node(3)
root.left.left, root.right.right = Node(4), Node(5)

# Inorder traversal
def inorder_traversal(node):
    if node:
        inorder_traversal(node.left)
        print(node.data, end=' ')
        inorder_traversal(node.right)

# Expected Output: 4 2 1 3 5
print("Inorder Traversal: ")
inorder_traversal(root)
```

## üîπ 2. What is the difference between a _Tree_ and a _Graph_?

### Answer

**Graphs** and **trees** are both nonlinear data structures, but there are fundamental distinctions between them.

### Key Distinctions

- **Uniqueness**: Trees have a single root, while graphs may not have such a concept.
- **Topology**: Trees are **hierarchical**, while graphs can exhibit various structures.
-  **Focus**: Graphs center on relationships between individual nodes, whereas trees emphasize the relationship between nodes and a common root.

### Graphs: Versatile and Unstructured

- **Elements**: Composed of vertices/nodes (denoted as V) and edges (E) representing relationships. Multiple edges and **loops** are possible.
- **Directionality**: Edges can be directed or undirected.
- **Connectivity**: May be **disconnected**, with sets of vertices that aren't reachable from others.
- **Loops**: Can contain cycles.

### Trees: Hierarchical and Organized

- **Elements**: Consist of nodes with parent-child relationships.
- **Directionality**: Edges are strictly parent-to-child.
- **Connectivity**: Every node is accessible from the unique root node.
- **Loops**: Cycles are not allowed.

## üîπ 3. Explain _Height_ and _Depths_ in the context of a _Tree_.

### Answer

In tree data structures, the terms **height** and **depth** refer to different attributes of nodes.

### Height

The **height** of a node is the number of edges on the longest downward path between that node and a leaf.

- **Height of a Node**: Number of edges in the longest path from that node to any leaf.
- **Height of a Tree**: Essentially the height of its root node.

### Depth

The **depth** or **level** of a node represents the number of edges on the path from the root node to that node. 

For instance, in a binary tree, if a node is at depth 2, it means there are two edges between the root and that node.

### Visual Representation

![Height and Depths in a Tree Data Structure](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/dev-stack-app.appspot.com/o/trees%2Ftree-height-depths%20(1).png?alt=media&token=3c068810-5432-439e-af76-6a8b8dbb746a&_gl=1*1gwqb6o*_ga*OTYzMjY5NTkwLjE2ODg4NDM4Njg.*_ga_CW55HF8NVT*MTY5NzMwNDc2OC4xNTYuMS4xNjk3MzA1OTk1LjUwLjAuMA..)

### Code Example: Calculating Height and Depth

Here is the Python code:

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data, parent=None):
        self.data = data
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
        self.parent = parent

def height(node):
    if node is None:
        return -1
    left_height = height(node.left)
    right_height = height(node.right)
    return 1 + max(left_height, right_height)

def depth(node, root):
    if node is None:
        return -1
    dist = 0
    while node != root:
        dist += 1
        node = node.parent
    return dist

# Create a sample tree
root = Node(1)
root.left = Node(2, root)
root.right = Node(3, root)
root.left.left = Node(4, root.left)
root.left.right = Node(5, root.left)

# Test height and depth functions
print("Height of tree:", height(root))
print("Depth of node 4:", depth(root.left.left, root))
print("Depth of node 5:", depth(root.left.right, root))
```

## üîπ 4. What is a _Diameter_ of a _Tree_?

### Answer

The **diameter** of a tree (or any other graph) refers to the longest path between any two nodes. In the context of a tree data structure, it represents the number of nodes on the **longest path** between two leaves.

### Key Points

- **Not Necessarily Through Root**: The longest path may or may not pass through the root.
- **Edge Count**: If you are counting the number of edges on the longest path, then the diameter would be one less than the number of nodes on that path.
- **Recursive Computation**: The diameter can be computed using a recursive approach, typically by calculating the height of left and right subtrees.

### Code Example: Calculating Diameter

Here is the Python code:

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

# This function will return two values: height and diameter
def height_and_diameter(node):
    if node is None:
        return 0, 0
    
    # Get height and diameter of left subtree
    l_height, l_diameter = height_and_diameter(node.left)
    
    # Get height and diameter of right subtree
    r_height, r_diameter = height_and_diameter(node.right)
    
    # The new height of the tree is the maximum height of its two subtrees, plus 1
    current_height = 1 + max(l_height, r_height)
    
    # Nodes on the longest path through the root
    nodes_through_root = l_height + r_height + 1
    
    # The new diameter is the maximum of the following:
    # 1. Diameter of left subtree
    # 2. Diameter of right subtree
    # 3. Number of nodes on the longest path through the root
    current_diameter = max(nodes_through_root, max(l_diameter, r_diameter))
    
    return current_height, current_diameter

# Create a sample tree
root = Node(1)
root.left = Node(2)
root.right = Node(3)
root.left.left = Node(4)
root.left.right = Node(5)
root.left.right.left = Node(6)
root.left.right.right = Node(7)

# Test the optimized function
_, tree_diameter = height_and_diameter(root)
print("Diameter of tree:", tree_diameter)
```

## üîπ 5. What is a _Binary Tree_?

### Answer

A **Binary Tree** is a hierarchical structure where each node has up to two children, termed as **left child** and **right child**. Each node holds a data element and pointers to its left and right children.

### Binary Tree Types

- **Full Binary Tree**: Nodes either have two children or none.
- **Complete Binary Tree**: Every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, with nodes skewed to the left.
- **Perfect Binary Tree**: All internal nodes have two children, and leaves exist on the same level.

### Visual Representation

![Binary Tree Types](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/dev-stack-app.appspot.com/o/binary%20tree%2Ftree-types.png?alt=media&token=847de252-5545-4a29-9e28-7a7e93c8e657)

### Applications

- **Binary Search Trees**: Efficient in lookup, addition, and removal operations.
- **Expression Trees**: Evaluate mathematical expressions.
- **Heap**: Backbone of priority queues.
- **Trie**: Optimized for string searches.

### Code Example: Binary Tree & In-order Traversal

Here is the Python code:

```python
class Node:
    """Binary tree node with left and right child."""
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
        self.data = data

    def insert(self, data):
        """Inserts a node into the tree."""
        if data < self.data:
            if self.left is None:
                self.left = Node(data)
            else:
                self.left.insert(data)
        elif data > self.data:
            if self.right is None:
                self.right = Node(data)
            else:
                self.right.insert(data)

    def in_order_traversal(self):
        """Performs in-order traversal and returns a list of nodes."""
        nodes = []
        if self.left:
            nodes += self.left.in_order_traversal()
        nodes.append(self.data)
        if self.right:
            nodes += self.right.in_order_traversal()
        return nodes


# Example usage:
# 1. Instantiate the root of the tree
root = Node(50)

# 2. Insert nodes (This will implicitly form a Binary Search Tree for simplicity)
values_to_insert = [30, 70, 20, 40, 60, 80]
for val in values_to_insert:
    root.insert(val)

# 3. Perform in-order traversal
print(root.in_order_traversal())  # Expected Output: [20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80]
```

## üîπ 6. What is a _Balanced Tree_?

### Answer

A **Balanced Tree** ensures that the **Balance Factor**‚Äîthe height difference between left and right subtrees of any node‚Äîdoesn't exceed one. This property guarantees efficient $O(\log n)$ time complexity for **search**, **insertion**, and **deletion** operations.

### Balanced Tree Criteria

- **Height Difference**: Each node's subtrees differ in height by at most one.
- **Recursive Balance**: Both subtrees of every node are balanced.

### Benefits

- **Efficiency**: Avoids the $O(n)$ degradation seen in unbalanced trees.
- **Predictability**: Provides stable performance, essential for real-time applications.

### Visual Comparison

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/dev-stack-app.appspot.com/o/binary%20tree%2FHeight-Balanced-Tree-2%20(1).png?alt=media&token=4751e97d-2115-4a6a-a4cc-19fa1a1e0a7d)



The **balanced tree** maintains $O(\log n)$ height, while the **unbalanced tree** could degenerate into a linked list with $O(n)$ height.

### Code Example: Balance Verification

Here is the Python code:

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

def is_balanced(root):
    if root is None:
        return True

    left_height = get_height(root.left)
    right_height = get_height(root.right)

    return abs(left_height - right_height) <= 1 and is_balanced(root.left) and is_balanced(root.right)

def get_height(node):
    if node is None:
        return 0

    return 1 + max(get_height(node.left), get_height(node.right))
```

## üîπ 7. Explain the _Breadth-First Search_ (BSF) traversing method.

### Answer

**Breadth-First Search** (BFS) is a graph traversal technique that systematically explores a graph level by level. It uses a **queue** to keep track of nodes to visit next and a list to record visited nodes, avoiding redundancy.

### Key Components

- **Queue**: Maintains nodes in line for exploration.
- **Visited List**: Records nodes that have already been explored.

### Algorithm Steps

1. **Initialize**: Choose a starting node, mark it as visited, and enqueue it.
2. **Explore**: Keep iterating as long as the queue is not empty. In each iteration, dequeue a node, visit it, and enqueue its unexplored neighbors.
3. **Terminate**: Stop when the queue is empty.

### Visual Representation

![BFS Example](https://techdifferences.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/BFS-correction.jpg)

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: $O(V + E)$ where $V$ is the number of vertices in the graph and $E$ is the number of edges. This is because each vertex and each edge will be explored only once.
  
- **Space Complexity**: $O(V)$ since, in the worst case, all of the vertices can be inside the queue.

### Code Example: Breadth-First Search

Here is the Python code:

```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(graph, start):
    visited = set()
    queue = deque([start])
    
    while queue:
        vertex = queue.popleft()
        if vertex not in visited:
            print(vertex, end=' ')
            visited.add(vertex)
            queue.extend(neighbor for neighbor in graph[vertex] if neighbor not in visited)

# Sample graph representation using adjacency sets
graph = {
    'A': {'B', 'D', 'G'},
    'B': {'A', 'E', 'F'},
    'C': {'F'},
    'D': {'A', 'F'},
    'E': {'B'},
    'F': {'B', 'C', 'D'},
    'G': {'A'}
}

# Execute BFS starting from 'A'
bfs(graph, 'A')
# Expected Output: 'A B D G E F C'
```

---

## üîπ 8. Explain the _Depth-First Search_ (DFS) algorithm.

### Answer

**Depth-First Search** (DFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that's simpler and **often faster** than its breadth-first counterpart (BFS). While it **might not explore all vertices**, DFS is still fundamental to numerous graph algorithms.

### Algorithm Steps

1. **Initialize**: Select a starting vertex, mark it as visited, and put it on a stack.
2. **Loop**: Until the stack is empty, do the following:
   - Remove the top vertex from the stack.
   - Explore its unvisited neighbors and add them to the stack.
3. **Finish**: When the stack is empty, the algorithm ends, and all reachable vertices are visited.

### Visual Representation

![DFS Example](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/dev-stack-app.appspot.com/o/graph-theory%2Fdepth-first-search.jpg?alt=media&token=37b6d8c3-e5e1-4de8-abba-d19e36afc570)

### Code Example: Depth-First Search

Here is the Python code:

```python
def dfs(graph, start):
    visited = set()
    stack = [start]
    
    while stack:
        vertex = stack.pop()
        if vertex not in visited:
            visited.add(vertex)
            stack.extend(neighbor for neighbor in graph[vertex] if neighbor not in visited)
    
    return visited

# Example graph
graph = {
    'A': {'B', 'G'},
    'B': {'A', 'E', 'F'},
    'G': {'A'},
    'E': {'B', 'G'},
    'F': {'B', 'C', 'D'},
    'C': {'F'},
    'D': {'F'}
}

print(dfs(graph, 'A'))  # Output: {'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G'}
```
